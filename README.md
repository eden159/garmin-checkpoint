Checkpoints
==============

Current Version: 0.3

I. Description 
---------------

This is a garmin Connect IQ app for people who want to know when the next 
checkpoint for a competition is. You enter up to 12 checkpoints and the 
distance to them (from the beginning, not from the previous checkpoint) and 
based on the elapsed distance the app shows you the next checkpoint, the 
distance it is at and the remaing distance to it. 
 
 The app also has the ability to offset the distances with +0.5 or -0.5 
  while in an activity by pressing 2 times (-0.5) or 3 times (+0.5) the 
  LAP key in a period of 4 seconds.
